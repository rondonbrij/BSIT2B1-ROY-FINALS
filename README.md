To run the Classic Models CRUD API on your PC, follow these simple steps:

Install Dependencies:
Open your command prompt and copy-paste the following commands to install the required dependencies:
    pip install flask flask-mysqldb
This will install Flask and Flask-MySQLdb, the essential modules used by the API script.

Configure Your MySQL Server:
After configuring your MySQL Server, open the "api_finals.py" script. Make sure that the database configuration within the script (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DB) matches your own database setup. This ensures seamless access to interact with the tables.

Run the API Script:
Locate the "api.bat" file and run it. This batch file takes care of running the API script for you, eliminating the need to open it separately. In case there are connection issues, you can manually run the "api_finals.py" file.

Enjoy and Optimize:
Start exploring the Classic Models CRUD API and witness the power it brings to your programming endeavors. Once you have finished using the client script, be sure to stop the API script as it may consume some of your computer's memory.
